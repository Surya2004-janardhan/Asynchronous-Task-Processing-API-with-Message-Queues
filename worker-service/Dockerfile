# Dockerfile - Worker Service
# 
# This file will:
# 1. Use an official Node.js runtime as the base image.
# 2. Set the working directory inside the container.
# 3. Copy package.json and install dependencies.
# 4. Copy the worker application source code.
# 5. Define the command to start the worker process (node src/main.js).
# 6. Ensure the worker can connect to RabbitMQ and MySQL via environmental variables.
